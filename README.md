**Pathfinding Visualizer**

Welcome to **Mars Rover**. I hope that you will enjoy playing around with this tool. You can access it here: https://sathvikabm.github.io/MARS-Rover/

This application supports the following algorithms:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted)

-  A Search* (weighted)

- Greedy Best-first Search (weighted)

4. Swarm Algorithm (weighted)

5. Convergent Swarm Algorithm (weighted)

6. Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm (weighted)

7. Breath-first Search (unweighted)

8. Depth-first Search (unweighted)

On top of the pathfinding algorithms listed above, We implemented a Recursive Division Maze Generation algorithm. Which has an option of both vertical and horizontal skew. You can generate Random Maze, Weight Maze, Stair Pattern as well.
